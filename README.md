**DESCRIPTION**

A plugin to make your server immersive like an rpg (using music).
NOTE: You need to use musics from a custom resource-pack for that. Btw, you DONT NEED Optifine or any mods for that, just search how to add sounds to the game using resource-packs.
Extra: All the sounds will play in the "Jukebox/Note Blocks" category instead of "Music" because there isn't a person who doesn't leave this mutated.



**DEPENDENCIES**

Obs: You NEED WorldGuard and WGRegionEvents (Updated // 1.13-1.21 version), in your plugins folder to use it.
